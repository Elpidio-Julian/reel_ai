Below is a detailed step‐by‐step plan covering analysis and MVP work, along with the additional feature roadmap:

──────────────────────────────
1. Preliminary Code Analysis

   A. main.dart  
      • Review the widget tree and navigation setup across the app.  
      • Identify how the upload flow (and its “add video” button) is wired into the overall routing.  
      • Note integration points where the media picker is invoked.

   B. Views (Upload, Gallery, etc.)  
      • Examine the Upload view to see how it currently initiates the media picker and handles video selection.  
      • Check for redundant or conflicting UI elements (e.g., camera capture button interfering with gallery selection).  
      • Map out where and how the published/unpublished states are or should be represented.

   C. camera_service  
      • Inspect the camera_service to understand its functionality (recording videos, camera initialization).  
      • Identify how it integrates with the upload flow – note that camera capture is now a tertiary concern.  
      • Determine if any of its functions are adversely affecting the media picker behavior.

──────────────────────────────
2. Fixing the Broken Upload Flow (MVP Priority)

   A. Decouple Camera Option from Upload  
      • Temporarily disable or decouple the camera capture integration from the upload “add video” button.  
      • Focus on restoring the ability to select existing gallery videos.

   B. Fix the Media Picker  
      • Replace or reconfigure the currently broken media picker implementation:  
         - Use the proper Android pattern (e.g., a native Intent via a Flutter package like image_picker, file_picker, or a specialized video picker) so that the user can select from existing videos.  
         - Ensure the picker now allows adding videos without forcing the user to browse for “new” files.
      • Validate on an actual Android device/emulator to confirm the correct behavior.

   C. Validate and Restore Upload Functionality  
      • Review the upload endpoint and its integration in the code (likely in the network or service layer).  
      • Ensure that once a video is selected, the upload process kicks in without errors.  
      • Implement additional logging and error handling to capture any issues.

──────────────────────────────
3. Implement the Video Gallery Feature

   A. Gallery UI Implementation  
      • Create a dedicated gallery screen that displays two sections/tabs:  
         - Unpublished: Videos that have been uploaded but not yet published.  
         - Published: Videos that are live and viewable by others.
      • Design the layout (grid or list) to include video thumbnails, metadata, and a simple status indicator.

   B. Data Flow and State Management  
      • Ensure that the gallery fetches video information from the back-end (or local model) in real-time or on refresh.  
      • Use appropriate state management (Provider, Riverpod, etc.) to separate business logic from UI.  
      • Handle loading states and error messages.

──────────────────────────────
4. Implement the Publishing Feature

   A. Publish Button/Toggle  
      • Within the gallery’s unpublished section, provide an option (button or toggle) to “publish” a video.  
      • Wire up an API call or local state update that marks the video as published.

   B. UI Feedback and Backend Update  
      • Update the gallery view so that once a video is published it automatically moves to (or appears in) the published tab.  
      • Validate that the state change is reflected both in the UI and on the back-end.

──────────────────────────────
5. Implement the Screen for Viewing Other Users’ Published Videos

   A. Create a “Community Videos” Screen  
      • Develop a simple screen that fetches all published videos (from multiple users).  
      • Use a simple sorting mechanism (random ordering is acceptable at first) to showcase available content.
   
   B. UI and Navigation  
      • Ensure users can easily navigate to this screen from the main menu or a footer.
      • Keep the interface minimal; focus on functionality over detailed filtering or sorting.

──────────────────────────────
6. Roadmap for the “Big” Feature – Video Editor Integration

   A. Integrate AWS Openshot API  
      • Investigate AWS Openshot API endpoints for video editing.  
      • Set up authentication/configuration to securely communicate with AWS.
   
   B. Develop the Template Editor  
      • Create a new “Editor” screen where creators can upload a video and choose a template designed to shrink a desktop video down to mobile dimensions.
      • Outline a simple UI flow: select video → show available templates → submit editing request → preview/download the mobile version.
   
   C. Testing and Iteration  
      • Test the round-trip editing process end-to-end.  
      • Collect errors and enhance error messaging/logging as needed.
   
──────────────────────────────
7. Final Steps and MVP Delivery

   A. End-to-End Testing  
      • Validate the entire flow:  
         - Video selection (media picker) → upload success.  
         - Video gallery displays proper sections and reflects changes (publish/unpublish).  
         - Viewing other users’ videos functions as expected.
      • Ensure that state management and error handling are robust.

   B. Documentation and Cleanup  
      • Document any API endpoints, expected configurations, and the integration of third-party packages (media picker, AWS Openshot).  
      • Clean up any temporary fixes (e.g., camera code isolation) as you formally integrate the features.
   
   C. Deploy and Monitor  
      • Deploy the MVP to a staging environment.  
      • Monitor user feedback and logs for any issues, then iterate as needed.

──────────────────────────────
This plan prioritizes restoring core upload functionality with a proper Android media picker and reliable uploads, then builds the video gallery along with publish and community viewing capabilities, and finally lays the groundwork for the more complex video editor integration using AWS Openshot.

Let’s now proceed to implement this plan step by step.
