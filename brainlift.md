# ReelAI Video Upload Flow Analysis

## Problem/Feature Overview

### Initial Requirements
1. User Authentication Flow
   - Email/password registration
   - Login functionality
   - Session management

2. Main Screen Features
   - Display uploaded videos
   - Video grid/list view
   - Basic video metadata

3. Navigation
   - Footer menu widget
   - Essential screen access
   - Smooth transitions

4. Video Management
   - Upload functionality
   - 3-minute video trimming
   - Video takedown capability
   - Progress tracking

### Key Challenges
- Complex state management across screens
- Video processing and storage optimization
- Permission handling (camera, storage)
- Clean navigation flow
- Error handling across services
- User experience optimization

### Success Criteria
- Seamless authentication flow
- Reliable video upload/processing
- Intuitive UI/UX
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean architecture

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt 1: Initial Implementation
- Approach: Basic camera and permission handling
- Implementation: CameraService and PermissionService
- Outcome: Functional but tightly coupled
- Learnings: Need better separation of concerns

### Attempt 2: Service Layer Refactor
- Approach: Business logic migration to services
- Implementation: VideoStorageService and RecordingTimerService
- Outcome: Better organization, residual view logic
- Learnings: State management needs improvement

### Attempt 3: Navigation and State
- Approach: Enhanced navigation patterns
- Implementation: Provider-based state management
- Outcome: More robust, edge cases remain
- Learnings: Error handling needs enhancement

## Final Solution

### Implementation Details
1. Service Layer
   - Clean architecture
   - Single responsibility services
   - Clear interfaces

2. State Management
   - Provider pattern
   - Clear state flows
   - Predictable updates

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error states
   - User-friendly messages
   - Recovery mechanisms

### Key Components
1. Services
   ```dart
   - CameraService
   - VideoStorageService
   - PermissionService
   - RecordingTimerService
   ```

2. Screens
   ```dart
   - LoginScreen
   - RegisterScreen
   - CameraScreen
   - VideoPreviewScreen
   - VideoTrimmerScreen
   ```

3. Providers
   ```dart
   - AuthProvider
   - VideoProvider (planned)
   ```
