# Design Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system design for our TikTok clone MVP. Our project uses an AI-first approach and is developed for Android using Flutter and Firebase, with AWS Openshot API integrated for video processing.

## Architecture Summary

- **Client Side (Flutter App):**
  - Utilizes the Firebase client SDK for user authentication, Firestore operations, and Storage access.
  - Uses Provider for state management and interacts with backend services via secure API calls or Firebase Cloud Functions for privileged operations.

- **Backend:**
  - Firebase Cloud Functions (or a dedicated backend) handles admin-level tasks using the Firebase Admin SDK.
  - Exposes secure endpoints for tasks such as user management, batch updates, and custom business logic.

- **System Design Principles:**
  - **C4 Model Alignment:** Our architecture is visualized using the C4 model with Mermaid diagrams for System Context, Container, and Component perspectives.
  - **Separation of Concerns:** Clear division between client and server responsibilities ensures both scalability and security.
  - **Modularity:** The design leverages providers, services, and a dedicated metrics module to maintain flexibility and ease of maintenance.

## Design Documentation

For detailed system design including diagrams, refer to the [System Design Document](SYSTEM_DESIGN.md).

## Future Considerations

- Enhance the Metrics Module with detailed analytics and monitoring tools.
- Transition to more robust state management solutions (e.g., Bloc or Riverpod) as the app scales.
- Continuously update design diagrams and architecture documentation to reflect evolving requirements and optimizations.
